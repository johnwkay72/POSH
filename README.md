# POSH
PowerShell Base REPO
# This is the Base/Master REPO for some Powershell Scripts I am have either developed or are in the development of.  The Branch called SNIPPETTS is for script/code fragments which can be used to call specific commonly used actions.  I will eventually transform those SNIPPETS into FUNCTIONS where it makes sense.
